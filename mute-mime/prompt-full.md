Build a "Mute Mime" for a video call tile in [YOUR STACK — e.g. React + Tailwind, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS].

WHAT IT DOES
Talk while you're muted and your voice bounces off an invisible glass box around your tile, like a mime trapped inside. Then it tells you you're on mute.

BEHAVIOR
1. A dark 220px video tile (radial gray gradient in both themes) with an 80px gradient avatar, and a dark translucent name chip in the corner with a red Lucide `mic-off` icon (white `mic` once unmuted). The Mute/Unmute button carries the Lucide `mic` icon. Below it: a Mute/Unmute button (tinted red while muted) and a "Hold to Talk" button for the demo. In a real call, drive it from voice activity.
2. While talking, spawn a ring every 420ms from the avatar (2px white border, 80px).
3. Muted:
   - Each ring grows until it meets the box's top and bottom edges (the box is inset 14px), holds, flattens slightly and fades.
   - As it hits, the box edge flashes: a 1.5px white inner border and a pale aqua inner glow fading over 480ms (the slower duration).
   - Faint corner brackets show the box while you talk.
4. After 1.4s of muted talking, a red-tinted panel says "You're on mute. You've been talking for 2 seconds." as one balanced paragraph (the count keeps rising, "1 second" when it is one, and the number never splits from "seconds"), with an Unmute button.
5. Unmuted, the rings turn green and expand freely to 6× over 1.2s before fading, and the tile gets a 3px green speaking border. The avatar pulses gently while talking.
Reduced motion: rings appear and fade without growing; the flash stays, slowed to 0.8s.

APPEARANCE (Outcraft Design System)
- Use the Outcraft Design System tokens listed under OUTCRAFT TOKENS at the end of this prompt, defined as CSS variables on the component's root element (light values by default, dark values when the page is in dark mode). Never hardcode colors, fonts, radii, shadows or timings anywhere else.
- Type: Geist for interface text (controls 14/20, body 15/22, small 13/18, caption 12/16; headings tighten as they grow), Geist Mono for code, keys and numbers that change. Fallback: system-ui.
- Color: warm grounds (Canvas #FAFAF8 page, Soft ground #F3F2EE behind white cards), Black #000 headlines, Slate #4A504D body text, Line #DCDED9 borders. Primary buttons are Black (Aqua #79EEEC with black text in dark mode). Aqua is the signature: highlights, brand buttons, selected states on Aqua 100 #CFF8F6; Aqua 700 #0B7573 for links, focus rings and progress on light grounds. Status uses the universal colors (Radix Red, Green, Amber, Blue): red #CE2C31 for errors, green #218358 for success, amber #FFC53D (black text) for warnings, blue #0D74CE for info, each with a soft tint and darker text. Orange #FE8C5F is the AI pill; Pink #FFC7F6 marks accent badges and steps. A colored panel, chip or soft fill is a tint of its color at a fixed lightness (OKLCH L 0.92 in light, 0.32 in dark, keeping 40% / 45% of its chroma), so pale Aqua and strong red separate from the card equally; never outlined. Colored text on a tint is held between OKLCH L 0.48 (a cap in light) and 0.75 (a floor in dark), so it reads in both themes, and gray secondary text on it uses the body gray. A soft red button (Decline, Delete, Cancel) is red at 16% in light and 30% in dark with deep red text (#AC2529 in light, #FF9592 in dark), never outlined; it centers its label.
- Shape: 8px radius for buttons and inputs, 12px for cards, 16px for large surfaces; pills only for badges, switches and floating bars; concentric corners. 1px borders; soft layered shadows only for things that float. Text that wraps to two or three lines reads as one paragraph whose lines are close in length, with the first line the longest (narrow the text block until that holds; never a long line with one or two words below it). A row with a title and a detail line under it sets each line at its own size and line height (detail 13/18 or 12/16, not the body's 22px), 2px apart, with equal space above and below (at least 8px), so the text never presses against a divider. A card's padding is measured to what you see: text at the top edge trims to its capitals (text-box: trim-start cap alphabetic) and text at the bottom edge to its baseline (text-box: trim-end cap alphabetic), so the space above matches the space below. Components hug their content: a status line, footer or message that is empty takes no space, and the card grows when text appears. Icons are Lucide with round line ends and joins; every tick, cross, plus, minus and chevron is the Lucide check, x, plus, minus or chevron icon, never a typed character or a shape drawn with CSS borders. A letter, initials or a number in a tile, avatar or count badge is centered on its capital height, not its line box (display: block; align-content: center; text-align: center; text-box: trim-both cap alphabetic), at a size whose capitals leave equal space above and below: 14px bold in tiles from 26 to 40px.
- Motion: our springs. Press feedback --spring-press (310ms) scaling to 0.97, controls --spring-ui (460ms, slight overshoot), panels --spring-panel (530ms, no bounce), delight --spring-pop (680ms). Animate transform and opacity only. Reduce Motion: 120ms fades.
- Floating surfaces use Frost: a translucent fill, 16px backdrop blur, 160% saturation, a 1px border and a large soft shadow.
- Accessibility: a 2px focus ring in the ring color with a 2px offset, 44px touch targets, text at 4.5:1, polite live regions for status lines.
- Copy: title-case button labels, sentence-case body text, no emoji. Every count uses the singular for one ("1 file", "1 second", "1 person"), including counts set by data attributes.
- This one: the tile and name chip stay dark in both themes, like a real camera feed.
